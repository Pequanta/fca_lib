## Installation

Install via `pip`:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or directly from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pequanta/fca_lib.git
cd fca_lib
pip install .
```

---

## Requirements

This project is compatible with Python 3.7+ and relies on the following dependencies:

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### Library Usage

```python
from fca import Context, ConceptLattice

# Load or construct a formal context
ctx = Context.from_csv('data/context.csv')

# Build and analyze the concept lattice
lattice = ConceptLattice(ctx)
for concept in lattice.concepts:
    print(concept)
```

*Adjust according to actual API in `fca/`.*

### Command-line Interface (CLI)

The CLI scripts are in the `cli/` folder. You can run them directly:

```bash
python -m fca_lib.cli.command_name --help
```

Or if installed as an entry-point:

```bash
fca-lib [command] [options]
```

Available commands include:

- `generate-lattice` â€“ Generate concept lattices from context files  
- `export-diagram` â€“ Export lattice visualizations  

*(Customize based on real CLI scripts.)*

---

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides sample scripts:

```bash
python examples/example_build_lattice.py
```

These demonstrate:

- Building lattices from data  
- Exporting DOT/graph outputs  
- Annotating concepts with attributes
