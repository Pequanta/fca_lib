# FCA\_LIB

A research-oriented Python library for **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)** with extensions for **classification, hypothesis generation, and optimization**. The project combines classical FCA methods with experimental approaches such as the **John Stuart Mill (JSM) method**, **Titanic iceberg pruning**, and **QUBO-based optimization** (for both classical solvers and quantum-inspired workflows).
